        <h3>Where Fresh Engineers Share Their Stories...</h3>
        <p>
          How do you know if engineering is "for you?" What can you do to become
          a great engineer? How do you take control of your career? And what do
          engineers actually do?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm mechanical engineer Anna Reich and I started the Fresh Engineer
          Podcast to help you get answers to exactly those questions. Join me as
          I sit down with fellow engineers to explore their journey into
          engineering and the lessons they have learned on the way.
