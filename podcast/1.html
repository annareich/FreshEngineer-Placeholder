          "I started studying engineering with the thought that, you know, how
          cool must it be to actually develop a piece of technology. I would see
          something like a headphone or a loud speaker or a computer or anything
          and just realizing there are people who design, develop these things
          just seemed so incredible to me - that anyone could be capable of
          doing that, that I could be capable of doing that, that I could be a
          part of that. I don't think I could believe that that's something that
          I could do."

        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the very first episode of the Fresh Engineer Podcast where
          fresh engineers share their stories. I'm your host and mechanical
          engineer Anna Reich and in today's episode I'm talking to Jeffrey
          Thomsen who is an audio and acoustics engineer working on audio
          equipment like headphones, speakers and hearing aids at the company GN
          Group in Copenhagen, Denmark. We met during the first week of our
          Bachelor studies at the Technical University of Berlin and we've been
          really close friends ever since. So, when he decided to come visit me
          in Stockholm for the weekend, I took the chance to persuade him to be
          the first guest on my podcast. In our conversation we talk about how
          his passion for music and technology led him to pursue a career in
          audio engineering, the difference between audio engineering, acoustics
          engineering and sound engineering, his experience of studying and
          later working abroad in Denmark and why he decided not to do a PhD
          despite his passion for research. So, I hope you enjoy our
          conversation as much as I did!
        </p>
        <h3>Interview</h3>
        <h4>
          Let's start all the way at the beginning. Where are you from, where
          did you grow up and what were you like as a kid? What were your
          interests?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Okay, so I was born in Hamburg, Germany - Northern Germany - and grew
          up in a suburb, in like multiple suburbs, of Hamburg. I used to be
          very interested in outer space as a kid. I had like Lego space station
          sets and books about the solar system including Pluto as the ninth
          planet. No one's ever going to take that away from me. If you want to
          argue with me about this later on, I won't. I got into music at a
          pretty early age, so I have a pretty clear memory of listening to
          music in the kitchen with my mom and I think my interests as a kid
          were somewhere between solar system, that's what I'm going to call it,
          solar system, being a rock star and being a secret agent. Those were
          all things that I thought were pretty cool.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Let's move on to your high school days... what were your favorite
          subjects in high school and how did that impact your career
          aspirations?
        </h4>
        <p>
          As I mentioned, music was a pretty important thing to me pretty early
          on, I would say almost as important as space in the beginning but
          music kind of took over as the years went on. I did manage to or or
          decide to go to a very music-focused high school. So, from age 10,
          that's kind of when you go to high school in Germany. So, for nine
          years I was on a very music-focused high school. I got to join lots of
          different musical ensembles and for a very long time I at least kind
          of played with the idea of studying music although I was always quite
          aware of the fact that that would take a lot of practice because, you
          know, unlike other types of study programs to study music you
          basically have to be a master at your subject before you even get
          started. So, you already have to be extremely good at playing the
          instrument that you want to study, for instance, and also really good
          at playing piano if that's not the instrument you want to study. And
          it's just like, yeah, the chances of getting into music college are
          not super high, I would say. What was the question? Oh, what were my
          favorite subjects. So the answer to that was music, I mean, especially
          as I got closer to graduating, music class was probably my favorite
          class and I kind of majored in music, if you want to call it that,
          throughout the last three years of high school. Apart from that, I
          guess, math. I talked to my brother sometimes about how we have this
          shared experience of kind of saving our math homework to like the end
          as kind of like a reward. So, all the other more text-based homework
          were less attractive and then we would keep math homework as, you
          know, kind of "dessert" of the the "homework meal", if you want to
          call it that. I mean, I liked a lot of things about high school. I
          liked learning different languages, I liked sciences.
        </p>

        <h4>
          When it was getting closer to graduation, what were the career options
          you were considering? Did you think about the subjects you liked or
          how did you make this decision and did you have any people that
          influenced you maybe in the field of engineering, someone in your
          family or acquaintances?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Yes, so, for sure I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what I
          wanted to study. It was not, interestingly, I want to say, it was
          never out of the question for me that I would study. I mean, getting a
          university degree is not the only thing that you can do to pursue a
          career but for me that was always super clear because somehow no one
          showed me any other alternatives. As I mentioned before, I was still
          considering going into music kind of art, I mean, music as an art
          form. But I was again super interested in all different types of
          subjects, so we had open university days in Hamburg where we'd go to
          the university and could kind of listen to lectures, like, all
          different subjects and, you know, as far as I was concerned, I could
          study almost anything. I was interested in philosophy, biology sounded
          pretty cool, and also then the more technology or engineering-related
          careers. Even though I found it really hard to imagine what an
          engineer actually did or what the study program would be like, there
          was something about the idea of developing technology, I don't know,
          sounded cool to me. And, yeah, I did try to talk to people who worked
          as engineers. I think that was an important point for me because I
          wanted to know what I would be doing after I got the degree. I never
          worried too much about, like, the actual study program because I guess
          I already knew that that's a finite period of time that you spend and
          the much longer period of time is the one that you're going to spend
          in a job, in a career. And I did go out and try to find engineers that
          I could ask questions, like: What is your regular workday like? What
          kind of stuff do you work on? I'm not really sure that helped me that
          much but, I mean, it must have because at least in the end I did
          decide to study an engineering career. So, what advice would you give
          a high school student who's considering to go into engineering but who
          maybe isn't so sure it's for them? Yeah, try to find engineers that
          are willing to answer some questions, that are willing to kind of
          paint you a vivid picture, what a day in the work life of an engineer
          looks like. If you're interested in different types of engineering,
          try to find different types of engineers. I would say, try to talk to
          as many people as possible because there's such a wealth of different
          job options that just talking to one person might not be
          representative or might not be the right job for you but just to get
          kind of a feel for that. In my case, it was a conversation that I had
          with an acoustic engineer, retired acoustic engineer, who through kind
          of complete coincidence I got in touch with and I had a phone call
          with this man. I never actually met him but I had a phone call with
          him and he told me about his work, how he had worked, I think, mostly
          in room acoustics, kind of planning different types of buildings like
          ice skating rinks and theaters, classrooms and so on and so forth from
          an acoustic point of view and I think that was a key a moment for me
          during my search that I realized, okay, there are people who work with
          sound waves in a technical setting and that just made total sense to
          me and that's when I knew that that's what I wanted to study quite
          specifically. And so now you graduated from high school and you
          decided to study, so, can you talk a little bit about what you studied
          and what that was like for you? So, so, in general, what I did then,
          was that this same man, this retired acoustic engineer, then told me,
          Oh, you want to study Acoustics? You got to go to Technical University
          of Berlin. I was living in Hamburg, he was living in Hamburg. He said
          that's the place you need to go, I'm like, okay, then I guess that's
          the place I do need to go. And, you know, I did my research and, you
          know, pretty much I found out that was the only place in Germany where
          I could specialize in Acoustics already during my bachelor's, so that
          made my choice of University very easy because there was, like, only
          one choice. I was lucky enough to get into that program which is
          called physical engineering or engineering physics, depending on how
          you want to translate that, I think. I loved going to University from
          day one. It was just, you know, maybe just because I love learning new
          stuff and, you know, you learn lots of new stuff and it was all
          technical which, you know, in a way it was really cool. Not that I'm
          not also interested in other types of subjects but it was maybe a
          little bit like going extremely hardcore on your kind of math and
          physics classes in high school and meeting people who are also
          interested in exactly that and doing that together, I think that was
          really a key experience for me that I had people on campus or in my
          study programs like you because we shared a lot of kind of the same
          courses during the first two, three semesters and that was really
          great.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Was there anything about your studies that was different from what you
          had expected or imagined?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Yeah, interesting question because I don't even know what I expected.
          I'm not sure I had much of an expectation at all of what university
          would be like apart from the fact that I guess I hoped that I would
          like it. So in that sense, no, I can't really answer that question. I
          would say I was not negatively surprised overall. One key almost like
          Mantra that has kind of followed me throughout my entire University
          career is that I never one day kind of regretted my study choice, even
          though there was a lot of room for that for me personally because
          there were a lot of different paths that I was considering and I
          obviously had to choose one, so it was very reassuring for me that at
          any point in time, when I kind of checked in with myself, that I felt
          like I was doing the right thing for myself.
        </p>

        <h4>What was the most difficult part of the studies for you?</h4>
        <p>
          The bachelor studies, if anything. Well, I mean, there were certain
          classes that were extremely hard for sure. In my case, for sure that
          was probably machine design, maybe electrical engineering was pretty
          tough. I had like one class in electrical engineering, like electrical
          engineering basics. I figured out that I don't find electricity very
          intuitive. I'm gonna say this on camera, it is really bad for an audio
          engineer, so please don't tell anyone. We'll keep it between us and
          everyone watching. So, please don't tell my employers. No one can ever
          find this, this is a secret. I always loved mechanics, found mechanics
          super intuitive. If I push this thing, you know what's gonna happen to
          it. You know it's gonna move or it's gonna fall over and that those
          are things that you can then calculate. I thought that was pretty cool
          in mechanics. But electricity is, like, ah to this day. I wish it was
          more intuitive to me but it just isn't, so probably those two classes.
        </p>

        <h4>
          After your Bachelor, you decided to go for a master's degree. Why did
          you decide to pursue a master's degree and how did you decide which
          master program to choose?
        </h4>
        <p>
          That's also a nice question. So, to recap, my bachelor's degree was
          called physics engineering or physical engineering which was, I would
          say, a bit like mechanical engineering but less machine design and
          more theory. More physics, more math. Yeah, more physics and more math
          basically. And I then used that program to specialize in what we call
          technical acoustics. So, how do sound waves work, how do they
          propagate through air and how can we describe that mathematically? And
          that was great, I loved that and I could have continued to do that in
          a master's degree, physical engineering, and do even more of that. I
          suppose, I could have stopped studying and gotten some kind of job but
          that's also something that never ever occurred to me, that I could
          stop studying after a bachelor's degree. I feel like in Germany, in
          the German University system, at least amongst engineers and in the
          sciences, it's a fairly usual path to choose to do a master's degree
          and to have a bachelor's degree which is three years in Germany and
          then a master's degree is another two. And I had absolutely no desire
          to get out of University. I loved being in University. I loved that
          life, I loved the freedom, I loved working on all those different
          subjects and a sizable part of me wishes I was still in University
          today. I'm not and that's also totally fine but that is definitely
          something that I could imagine. As to choosing my master program or a
          masters degree, the funny thing about that is I actually knew about
          the program that I chose before I even started my bachelor's. So, as I
          as I told you before, I had a conversation with this retired acoustics
          engineer and then based on his input I did my research and looked for
          acoustics related programs at TU Berlin. And one of the things that
          popped up really soon was a master's degree called Audio Communication
          Technology. And every program had a little website describing what the
          program is about and they had a bullet list of topics that they do
          research on and I just read that list and it all sounded extremely
          cool and very exciting to me and just the thought that I could work on
          any of those was very fast fascinating to me. I'm trying to remember a
          few of those topics. I suppose things such as what nowadays we tend to
          call spatial audio - simulating virtual acoustic scenes with a
          computer simulation, very much like how we simulate visual
          environments with VR glasses. Basically doing that same thing but for
          audio and these types of things. So, I want to say, my entire study
          path was pretty predetermined before I even walked in the door on day
          one into Technical University of Berlin. That being said, I did,
          because I do like to make sure that I make good decisions, spend quite
          a bit of time kind of revising that decision as I got to the end of my
          bachelor's degree. I was looking at a few different programs because
          now, of course, I had three years of experience and I'd taken a bunch
          of interesting classes. One of the things that I considered, for
          instance, was a master's called, I think, Scientific Computing which
          is somehow an interface between coding, programming and using that to
          do research. I had discovered throughout two or three classes in my
          bachelor's that I really enjoyed coding and I really enjoyed also
          simulations which you usually need some piece of software for or you
          need to code them yourself in in some environment like Matlab or in a
          language like Python or C. So, I did also think about doing that. I
          think, I even took one or two classes from that degree just out of
          interest but then, ultimately, it was the audio thing that I wanted to
          do and that I wanted to learn most about and the kind of the study
          program that was the most interesting to me. And yeah, then I did
          that.
        </p>

        <h4>Were you happy with the master program when when you started?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes, absolutely. I stand by what I said earlier and not one day during
          my studies did I think, oh this was the wrong... I chose the wrong
          program. So, the great thing for me about this Audio Communication
          Technology program is that it is immensely interdisciplinary, so they
          kind of force us to do not only technical courses is but also some
          kind of empirical methods to conduct surveys and listening tests in
          music psychology. I did one or two classes in musicology, kind of
          music science. We had offers from sound artists giving seminars and
          actual music as an art form classes where you would use some technique
          to create experimental music alongside a bunch of technical classes
          like audio technology - how does a loudspeaker work, how does a
          microphone work, how does... what happens if you put a loudspeaker
          into a room, how does the room respond to that?

        <h4>
          You also went abroad to Denmark during your master's. Why did you do
          that and how was that experience for you?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I wish I knew why. It was definitely not my initial plan, I want to
          say, I had decided before I started my master's that I wanted to grow
          abroad during my master's, basically do an exchange semester. A lot of
          my friends had done that during their bachelor's. I had not but that
          was also due to the reason that I had been abroad before in the past,
          during high school and after high school as well and I moved newly to
          Berlin so I didn't have the innate drive to see another new place
          during that episode. But then when I got to my master's, I thought,
          yeah, it's time and I want to go abroad again because it's always
          given me a lot of great stuff and I've always grown immensely during
          the times that I traveled abroad. So, in a way it was kind of a
          no-brainer. I did intend to go somewhere very far away, I was looking
          at a study program similar to mine in Taiwan and I was basically
          looking at study options fairly far away from from Berlin but none of
          those really seemed to materialize for different reasons. I think,
          that program that I wanted to join in Taiwan, turned out, they closed
          that down and then that was no longer an option.And then I sort of had
          this notion that I'd like to see what Scandinavia is like because I'd
          heard a lot of, I want to say, good things about it, things that
          interested me. I know I had read a report once that, I think, Denmark
          is one of the most efficient countries in the world. So, the piece of
          information was that Danish people create the highest per capita GDP
          per working hour in, I don't know, Europe, I guess. Does that make
          sense? Yeah. So, somehow they managed to generate more wealth per hour
          than people in other countries while also having one of the lowest
          average weekly working hours in Europe and I think that combination
          really appealed to me, just as a concept, like, working less but
          achieving, being more effective during those working hours. I thought,
          that's an idea I definitely subscribe to and just one example of cool
          thing things that I had heard about living and working in Scandinavia,
          that I'd be interested to try out. It was in the end a bit more of a
          coincidence I would say, because I was looking for an internship. We
          had to do some kind of internship for my Master's Degree and I didn't
          have a super clear vision of what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to
          work with audio and I mean that's obviously also expected in my
          degree, that an internship is somehow audio-related but apart from
          that I could pretty much choose whatever I wanted. And then I found an
          internship, I found an opening online by a company called Bang &
          Olufsen which I had heard of, like, a company that I knew because they
          make loudspeakers, really nice looking loud speakers, and they have
          quite a strong brand. So, when I saw that, that really spoke to me,
          this idea that I could actually go into that company and become part
          of their R&D unit for a while. So, I applied for that internship and
          luckily I got it and I was just so happy because it was, like, at that
          point in time, I think it was like the coolest thing of my life, also
          because in a way that was one of the kind of end goals of my
          engineering studies, if you will. I started studying engineering with
          the thought that, you know, how cool must it be to actually develop a
          piece of technology. I would see something like a headphone or a
          loudspeaker or, I mean, any type of, any piece of technology really, a
          computer or, you know, anything and just realizing, there are people
          who design, develop these things just seemed so incredible to me, that
          anyone could be capable of doing that, that I could be capable of
          doing that, that I could be a part of that? That was, like, I don't
          think I could believe that that's something that I could do, even when
          I started studying engineering. As like, I mean, I guess this is what
          people study that want to do that but it was like, it wasn't reality
          to me until I saw this internship at you know a company that develops
          audio technology, a company that I think is cool, that would be
          exciting to work for and they have an internship opening and their
          requirements fit extremely well to my study background, so that was
          the first time that I realized, okay, I guess, I could actually do
          this type of work. And I applied for the internship and I got it and
          then what I tried to do is add onto that an exchange semester in the
          same country. Bang & Olufsen is a Danish company. They have their
          headquarters in rural western Denmark and I thought it would be very
          fitting if I could also do an exchange semester at Denmark Technical
          University. So, then I applied for that as well. A bit risky, I did
          not... You know, when you apply for an exchange program at TU Berlin
          you put down up to three options of where you might like to go and I
          decided to not do that and I only put down Denmark Technical
          University because I realized I didn't actually want to go anywhere
          else and that worked out okay, I guess, a bit risky. And then I had
          this really nice year abroad lined up of 10 months. Five months in the
          internship, five months at the University. And Denmark is just in
          general a very good country for the audio and acoustics industry.
          Those Industries are very strong in Denmark which also meant that the
          study programs at the Technical University were pretty strong and
          there were some really interesting classes that I could take there.

        <h4>
          To round off your university experience that we talked about today,
          what advice would you give a fresh engineering student who is on the
          first day of their university experience? How can they make it through
          their engineering studies?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think one key skill, if you want to call it that, that I identified
          not only during university actually also already back in high school,
          figure out how the system works. Meaning, figure out exactly what you
          need in order to pass an exam for instance or whatever is needed to
          pass the course whether it's written assignments or group work to not
          get lost. And I always try to figure out, how am I going to be
          measured? How is my performance going to be assessed? And try to
          understand that as good as possible because otherwise you run the risk
          of learning things in a course which is great and enjoying a course
          which is also great and very important but in the end you want to at
          least pass that class so you can continue finishing your degree and I
          don't think it's always super intuitive how your success in a class is
          measured. So, the earlier you can figure that out in the semester, the
          better because then that gives you the agency to decide, I can work on
          this because I'm interested in learning that and that's great and I do
          that but I'm also very aware of, in order to pass this class, this is
          what I'm gonna have to be good at, these are the questions that I'm
          going to need to answer or this is the, whatever, mathematical skill
          that is going to be asked of me in the exam. Things like that. I think
          that probably helped me a lot because I think it can be very
          disappointing to think you've really enjoyed a subject and really
          think you've learned a lot but then you get to the exam and realize,
          the way they're assessing this is completely different from what I
          thought it was. I always think it's good to not have to do things
          alone. I mean, one of the great things about University for me,
          especially in the beginning, was that I had great people around me who
          were doing the same thing, were studying the same classes and having a
          collective experience. I'm sure it helped me academically but what's
          probably more important is that it made it a lot more fun, even when a
          class is really hard, you still got nice people around to not only try
          and figure it out together but also just to have fun together, to
          realize that there is more to life than just studying. I liked
          learning, I liked doing certain things, I liked coding tasks for
          example and that's great and so I should do those but maybe in the
          exam there's no coding at all, so try to strike that balance.

          After university, what was it like to look for your first job? How did
          you try to find a job and what went into your decision which job to
          choose? And how long ago was this actually?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This was last year, this was pretty much exactly one year ago. I mean,
          12 months ago, I was in the process of writing my master thesis,
          sending applications, looking for job openings. I had for a long
          period of time during my studies considered to actually stay at
          university and do a PhD because that seemed to be a fairly regular
          thing to do, especially in the audio communication program that I was
          in. That was a path that was, I almost want to say, advertised to us
          and I liked being at university. I generally liked research, so I
          thought about that for a long time but the longer I was in university
          and the longer I did research-based work, whether it was through my
          master thesis or through student jobs that I had at the university, I
          realized, I don't think I'm super good at having gigantic projects to
          deal with all on my own with kind of very minimal guidance which I
          started to figure out is exactly what a PhD is and I thought that that
          wouldn't be super good for my mental health because then starting a
          PhD, having to define your own goal and then somehow organize yourself
          to reach that research and publication goal within three years or five
          years... I thought it would be a lot better for me to work in more of
          a industrial... what we call industrial setting with smaller projects,
          more people involved, more accountability, shorter deadlines and
          that's just something that I really wanted to try out. And I had had a
          really positive experience at my internship at Bang and Olufsen which
          is a company that develops audio products, so I got at least a taste
          of what product development is like and I think that's the main thing
          that I took with me when I searched for jobs. So, yeah, I would say my
          main goal was to find a job as product development engineer in the
          audio industry. That was the dream goal for me and that's what I then
          went on looking for.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What job do you do now, what is your job title and what kind of
          company do you work at?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think I'm called a global audio engineering graduate, yeah I believe
          that's the title, so I'm not even quite sure what that title means.
          I'm about six months into working in a corporate environment and right
          now I'm starting to realize I don't really know how a lot of this
          stuff works, but what I can say is, I am in a so-called graduate
          program which in Denmark is a pretty common, I want to say, pretty
          popular way of starting your career. It is a regular full-time and
          entrance pay, entrance position in a company and in this graduate
          program I get to try out three different current positions in two
          years, so eight months each. I get to work in three different
          departments and try out different aspects of audio engineering, so
          basically anywhere inside the company where audio engineers work,
          that's where I can potentially go and do a rotation and see what the
          work environment is like. Am I good at these types of tasks? And of
          course also get a broader overview of how the whole organization
          works. So, that was a really attractive option to me because as I just
          confessed, I don't actually know how the corporate world really works
          and I don't really know what working as an engineer can be like per
          se, so the option to try out three different jobs at full pay in two
          years was a great gift for me and for my orientation, so I hoped. The
          company that I work at is called GN, they're one of the larger
          companies in Denmark, even, I believe, definitely one of the larger
          audio companies worldwide, I think. And, generally speaking, they have
          kind of two tracks. They have a medical track where they do hearing
          aids, different types of hearing aids, and then there is the audio
          track where they do professional and consumer audio products, mostly
          office headsets. And on the consumer side, mostly wireless earbuds.
          Those are kind of the main product categories that GN develops and
          sells.
        </p>

        <h4>
          You mentioned to me before that you're both an audio and acoustics
          engineer and that those two are not the same thing, so I'd love to
          know, what is the difference?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Right now, as I said, my job title is audio engineer and the
          company... I call it an audio company because they make audio products
          and the main innovation in the field of audio happens on the software
          side, so it's a very software-heavy industry, I would say. And to
          distinguish that from the work of an acoustic engineer, I would say,
          acoustics is generally concerned with the physical phenomenon of sound
          waves traveling through air whereas audio is mostly concerned with
          audio signals that you either try to capture with a microphone and
          then process them in a better way. For instance, GN makes headsets, so
          it's really important that the voice quality that they pick up with
          their microphones is really really good. And what makes that an audio
          challenge is that, with the headsets, we don't try to change the sound
          waves in the room because, you know, we can't. What we can do is we
          can try to use the microphones in a smarter way so that they pick up
          more of the speaker's voice and less of the reverberation and less of
          the surrounding noise. (Anna: Whatâ€™s reverberation?) Like echo. So,
          whereas looking at that same problem from an acoustics perspective,
          you'd be more concerned with, well, maybe we can change the room that
          we're in to kind of dampen the sound or make the sound a bit more
          pleasant so it's easier to concentrate or we can understand people who
          are speaking more easily. It can be a lot more technical as well like,
          how good is the sound insulation, if you know we have a wall between
          two apartments, how good does that insulate the sound in between the
          two neighbors. That's something that acoustics engineers could work
          on. So, that's more closely linked to civil engineering and then the
          other thing that acoustics engineers can do is what I would say is
          more linked to mechanical engineering where you have any type of
          machine really that makes noise. Often you want this machine to be
          less noisy. You want a washing machine to be less noisy, you want a
          vacuum cleaner to be less noisy, you want a car to be... possibly you
          want it to be less noisy or maybe you want it to be more noisy because
          then, you know... It's cooler. It's cooler. Yeah, exactly. And that
          has a lot to do with how the sound waves... how sound is generated by
          the machine and how it travels for instance through the structure,
          like, how do the sound waves travel from the motor through the car to
          the driver's ear for instance and that's more the acoustics domain
          whereas, if I think about, sticking with a car, maybe we want to do a
          cool thing where we use the loudspeaker system inside the car to do
          noise canceling then that's very much an audio challenge because now
          you have to figure out a software that tells the loudspeakers how to
          behave in order to cancel out certain noises. So, that's, I guess, my
          try to to distinguish these two industries or these two disciplines a
          little bit. And I have a little bit of both since I did acoustics in
          my bachelor's, audio in my masters. But you can't really separate them
          completely because, of course, they're linked and there's always parts
          of one in the other. Especially, you can't really do audio without
          somehow knowing how sound waves work because, in the end, you're
          always going to generate sound waves and so you need some
          understanding of how that works.
        </p>

        <h4>
          I'd love for you to paint a little picture of your workday and your
          work environment. What are you wearing, where do you work and what
          does a typical work day look like?
        </h4>
        <p>
          So, I typically work at an office. I do have the possibility to work
          from home pretty much whenever I want to. My employer is pretty open
          to that, not least because we make headsets that are made for digital
          collaboration, so the whole idea of that people want to be able to
          work from everywhere, that's very much ingrained in our mission
          statement. So, it would be weird if we didn't allow our employees to
          do the same. But I really like going to the office. It's an office in
          like an industrial park a little bit outside of Copenhagen. So, I
          commute there about 40, 50 minutes by public transport and it's an
          open office environment. I have my own desk, I sit like at an island
          of desks with like five other people and there are lots of these kind
          of islands all around in in the office. I don't know how many people
          there are in our entire audio engineering department but the last time
          I counted it must have been around 60 or something, whereas the entire
          organization has like several thousand employees worldwide and
          probably like one or two thousand in headquarters, that's our
          headquarters in Denmark. There is no consideration whatsoever to dress
          code, so I wear pretty much anything that I feel like and no one
          really cares. I guess that's because as a research and development
          engineer, I don't really have customer contact and, I would say,
          there's enough kind of artsy spirit amongst audio engineers that it's
          not weird to dress super casually or whatever way you want so, I would
          wear this hoodie or I would wear you know any other, even more casual
          top. In summer, I would probably go in wearing t-shirt and shorts
          without even thinking twice about it. That's about where I'm at dress
          code wise. I would for sure, myself, that's just me, dress up if I'm
          giving like an important presentation. I would probably wear like a
          shirt and a nice pair of pants and clean shoes and stuff. And that's
          also completely fine. I don't feel like there's any pressure or any
          expectation to wear a certain type of clothes for my work and it's not
          necessary out of either customer facing requirements or safety
          requirements. That's not really an issue for us. What were the other
          questions? Oh, what's my work day like. I'm not sure I can give a very
          representative answer about this because the work that I'm currently
          doing in my first rotation of my audio engineering graduate program is
          not super closely related to audio, but hey, it can happen, maybe
          that's one of the learnings from this podcast. So, I went and kind of
          day one, if you will, started my program. I knew my manager, I knew
          which department I would be in - it's called the audio technology
          department. So, we develop new technology, meaning new algorithms for
          future products and they told me they would be really interested in me
          doing a sustainability investigation on whether we could reuse certain
          components in mass production, kind of getting our used products back,
          taking them apart and reusing certain components, rather than having
          to source them from virgin material or buy new components from our
          supply buyers. Which, to be completely honest, is zero to do with
          anything that I ever thought I would do as an audio engineer and,
          again, I don't think it's super representative of what audio engineers
          in my company company usually do. My regular work day is comprised of
          talking to different people all around the organization, because in
          order to make this idea work, there are lots of different disciplines
          involved. So, audio is like one fairly small discipline, mechanical
          design of the products is an important aspect, supply chain and
          operations is an important aspect, you know, how can we actually
          transport these used products back? Is that even viable? Does this
          make sense from a cost perspective? Does this make sense from a
          sustainability perspective? Because that was the original idea, so,
          making an estimate, would this actually save carbon emissions if we
          did it this way? And during this project, basically, I'm trying to
          figure out what this whole product life cycle looks like from
          designing the component to making the mechanical design, manufacturing
          that, then somehow getting it back after the customer doesn't want it
          anymore, and then putting it back into mass production and trying to
          figure out which of these parts already exist, which don't or which
          kind of partly exist and would need some work, and then to give some
          recommendations. That's basically what my project's like and so it's a
          mix of doing a little bit of research, mainly asking different people
          for expert advice. I like to call my project a hunt for expert guesses
          because none of this is an established practice so it's really down to
          having very experienced people say, yeah, I think this could work if
          we did that and that. And you really need to make sure that... I don't
          know if I can give a simple example. Like, you need to be really
          careful about re-importing used goods into China because that might
          not even be possible, try to figure that out. And then I'm like, okay,
          well, who might know about this? Then I need to attract the person
          inside the organization who knows best and then ask them and then
          that's kind of what my day-to-day work looks like, which is again not
          very audio-related. I think most people around me are concerned either
          with developing and testing out new types of audio algorithms. Like,
          for instance, the thing that I mentioned with the voice clarity, if we
          have a headset, how much background noise does the microphone pick up?
          Can we figure out some way to reduce that because that would improve
          the call quality? And then those are considerations as to, what kind
          of microphones are we using, how are we going to place them on our
          device and what kind of algorithm, meaning what kind of audio
          software, are we going to use to ideally capture, to optimally capture
          the sound that we want which is just the speaker's voice?

        <h4>
          What is your favorite part of your current job and what is your least
          favorite part?
        </h4>
        <p>
          My my favorite part by far of this assignment is that I get to walk
          around and talk to people far and wide in the organization, in the
          company, and learn what they're working on and learn what their
          struggles are, who they have to "fight with" in order to make certain
          things work and that has given me, I don't know whether joy is the
          right word, but I find it very very interesting to figure out that in
          industrialization, the project manager would love to improve the
          assembly line but he can never quite get there because of time
          constraints from product management or something like that and to
          understand how these dependencies work in a very grand scale, I think
          that's pretty cool and very unique to this project. I know that that's
          not something I'm gonna get to do later on if I take a fixed position
          in audio engineering. The thing that I like least or the thing that I
          would say I struggle with most is that this is a very explorative
          project, it didn't come with very clear set out goals to begin with
          and that's made it a bit hard for me to focus at times and to have a
          clear direction and that's a bit frustrating at times. And, you know,
          to be completely honest, you know, one of the main main reasons why I
          went away from university is because I was hoping - you remember what
          I said earlier - I was hoping to get multiple smaller projects with
          shorter deadlines and constraints from the outside and instead I've
          gotten like the complete opposite assignment here. Everything has up-
          and downsides. I'm super happy that they gave me this assignment
          because I know I'm learning a bunch of stuff that I would have no
          chance to learn in any other project and I'm really really grateful
          that I'm getting this opportunity.

        <h4>
          What is one misconception about your industry or your profession that
          most people get wrong?
        </h4>
        <p>
          For many people, the misconception that I know how audio equipment
          works and then people come and ask me about advice or, like, which
          microphones they should buy for their podcasts or something... No, in
          all honesty, there is a very big misconception when I tell people that
          I'm an audio engineer or I used to tell people I'm studying to be an
          audio engineer. The picture that most people have in their heads is
          like someone who works at a recording studio and sets up microphones
          and records music or records spoken word and mixes these recordings or
          maybe someone who works in live sound and sets up loudspeakers on
          stages and works with the mixing board. And that is very very far away
          from what I... I could not do, I'm pretty sure, I could not do any of
          that particularly well. I think, you know, recording music is
          something that maybe I taught myself a little bit in my free time as
          like a sort of a side project but it's nothing that was actually part
          of my audio degree and I guess, I mean, I understand where the
          misconception comes from because that's I think... I don't even know
          what you would call it... Maybe like a sound engineer? Sound engineer
          is what I think you would call it in English. Yeah, exactly, that's
          what I would call a sound engineer and that's like a very visible job,
          right? You know that these people exist and you've maybe seen them in
          movies or whatever or you know you've seen them at concerts when
          you've gone to concerts. You know, oh that's the audio guy right -
          which is true, it's the audio guide or girl and what I do is, I
          develop the technology sound engineers use, so I could go to a
          microphone company and develop the microphones and improve them or
          improve the loudspeakers or the mixing desks, I suppose. But I don't
          actually work in a recording studio and I'm not even sure how academic
          of a profession that is, like, I'm not too sure how much these the
          people in like sound engineering, how much they would get out of
          writing multiple kind of scientific bodies of work, like, you know,
          bachelor thesis, master thesis and what not. I mean it's, I think, a
          much more practical profession.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What advice would you give someone looking for the first engineering
          job in your industry?
        </h4>
        <p>
          In my industry? Oh gosh. If you have the opportunity to do an
          internship during your university degree, please do that. I did two of
          them. I did also slightly longer internships than I had to, I mean,
          than were required just so I could get a bit more proper exposure and
          both of those internships were super valuable for me to navigate the
          job market just a little bit. It helped me just enough to figure out,
          okay, I think audio product development is probably something that I
          would like to do. Just enough for me to say, yes, okay, I will apply
          to audio product development engineer positions and kind of have
          enough confidence to say, yes, I have a qualifications for this, I can
          do this. I did not know exactly what my work would be like before I
          started and as I then found out it was even farther removed from audio
          then I had anticipated. There are different things that audio
          engineers do. They're people who do more artistic work. They'll go and
          become maybe like sound designers for video games or any kind of audio
          related content. You should maybe think about how much you want to
          work in a corporate environment, meaning, kind of product development.
          I think you should think about whether you'd rather work in a large or
          a small company. One thing that I found a lot amongst my classmates in
          the audio technology program is there's a real kind of spread between
          more like engineering-focused people with an engineering background
          like me and then there were also people with an artistic background
          who were maybe sound engineers and then decided to do something a bit
          more academic or they were actual sound artists and and decided to do
          something a bit more academic or something a bit more technical and
          yeah, what I understand is that, I guess it makes a large difference
          for how you feel whether you like a very corporate environment or a
          kind of semi-corporate environment where you're still obviously
          somehow in a profit-driven business but maybe it's a smaller business
          with a product that you really believe in or maybe it's something more
          artistic and all of those are great options. But I also do think that
          the type of work can differ quite greatly, so maybe try to figure that
          out first and then for me, I mean, the path that I took was very clear
          in technical engineering and also now very clearly the corporate
          route. I don't know where I was going with this but, I mean, I think
          this was great advice to do internships if you can. The size of the
          company that will fit you and to understand a little bit what the job
          is. I think that's just a little bit... I mean, I don't know whether
          this is a problem that you have but I kind of want to know things in a
          lot of detail and I think I had to kind of accept that there was a
          fair amount of uncertainty, of not knowing what the work, what working
          as an audio engineer was exactly like and just trusting that I would
          be qualified for that with the degree that I have which I'm sitting
          now on the other side of that process can happily say, it turns out, I
          am, so that's good. If you manage to get an engineering degree then,
          whether you believe it or not, that does qualify you to do engineering
          work. Sounds maybe like super stupid but this is definitely something
          that I didn't necessarily believe in the past.
        </p>

        <h4>
          And as an audio engineer or acoustics engineer or both, what are some
          other industries that you could work in?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Oh wow, that is also an interesting question. Well, what you will see
          as an audio engineer, there are some other skills that you might
          acquire or that you might use a lot during your work, especially
          coding, so maybe you would become like, you call that like, someone
          who programs embedded systems which is... for our audio products those
          are the digital signal processors, the sound chips that are inside the
          headphone or the loudspeaker that have the algorithms. That I believe
          is a skill that you could very comfortably transfer to any type of
          electronic equipment. Maybe with some extension you'd even be able to
          get a job as a software engineer. That at least is something that I
          kind of contemplate from time to time, that, if I did enough coding in
          my current work, could I at some point work as a software engineer if
          I wanted to do that? Also, if you choose to do so and if your company
          is interested in that, machine learning is a pretty big part of audio
          algorithms nowadays, so you might learn about or specialize in machine
          learning and then that I think is very easy to see that that is a
          skill that you could easily transfer to maybe a different industry
          that uses machine learning for their purposes. And I believe that's
          probably every industry right now, at least that's what it feels like
          to me. And then if you're more on the acoustic side and if you... we
          haven't talked about that that much because that's not the job that
          I'm doing right now but I think as an acoustics engineer you're fairly
          close to certain disciplines of mechanical engineering, so dynamics,
          vibrations which is I guess an important part of certain machines
          vehicles for sure. There's a lot of overlap there. You could work in
          the automotive industry as an acoustic engineer, I mean, I can't like
          promise you this but I could imagine that with the technical skill set
          that you have and with the classes that you've taken as an acoustic
          engineer to some extent you might also be able to do something closer
          related to mechanical engineering, but this is a bit of a guess
          because I haven't actually ever considered switching the industry. But
          actually it's a very nice question because now that I've thought about
          this maybe, maybe at some point I will. Who knows, it's good to know
          you have more options.
        </p>

        <h4>
          I'd like to now move on to your personal life and how that relates to
          engineering. So, are there any ways in which the fact that you are an
          engineer or that you became an engineer has impacted or maybe even
          taken over parts of your life?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I guess, I have thought about that time and again and I'm not
          completely sure whether I would coin them like... because I'm and call
          it because I'm an engineer, I mean that's one way to look at it. I
          think another way to look at this maybe because I have like a very
          scientific approach to things. I mean, those are maybe kind of similar
          categories.People who meet me and hang out with me in my private life,
          they will probably be amazed at how much I enjoy you know weighing
          things in the kitchen, so, if I have a recipe, I think it's really
          nice to accurately follow the instructions, kind of to like scientific
          accuracy. I don't know whether that's an engineering thing or whether
          it's a scientist thing or whether that even matters but yeah, I would
          definitely, say my kitchen scale is my favorite and most used kitchen
          utensil. So, I'll just leave that at that. The other parts of my
          life... it's difficult to see from the inside, right? From my point of
          view, but time and again, someone will tell me, wow you have a very
          analytical way of thinking. I'm like, do I? I think I have a normal
          way of thinking. But of course that's because I think the way that I
          do. That's the only way I know, right? I can get very excited about
          choosing to buy a new piece of technology, especially piece of audio
          technology of course, but any type of technological or technical
          acquisition, I will gladly spend a very long time looking at the specs
          and trying to figure out what's the perfect spec set for my needs. And
          trying to optimize finding the optimal product... I think, I optimize
          a lot, not just purchasing decisions, also just in general, like,
          optimizing processes in in my life and stuff like that. So yeah, it
          probably shows very very clearly. I don't think about it too much,
          like, I don't like on a day to day basis think, oh yeah, that's the
          engineer in me. But I don't know maybe it's very obvious if someone
          else saw me. Okay, but generally these are all traits of myself about
          myself that I like so I'm fairly comfortable with all of those.
        </p>

        <h4>
          You are 27 now which I know because we're the same age, minus two
          days. What are your career goals going forward and where do you see
          yourself in the next five years?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Yeah, I have absolutely no idea. Okay, that's a bit of a lie but at
          the moment I'm very busy figuring out how a company works and how
          corporate work works and I don't know how work works so I'm learning
          that right now. And then once I figure that out a little bit, I'll
          start getting an idea of where I want to take that. I'm, I would say,
          equally interested in going down some like technical specialization
          route so, for example, one kind of skill that I really enjoyed during
          university was acoustic simulations, that's something we also do in my
          company, and really diving deep and becoming more of an expert,
          technical expert, in that specific discipline, that's one path that I
          see. And on the other hand, I am also, I want to say, equally
          interested in dealing with humans which in the long run probably means
          something like management because I do think a lot about communication
          and working together in a better way, kind of improving the efficiency
          of teamwork and I also think it's a pretty nice mission to help people
          do their job as best they can and probably also be kind of organized
          and having an overview and planning stuff. So yeah, despite the fact
          that I always idealized a technical, specialization kind of career,
          I'd definitely be interested to see whether I can try out something
          like management at some point. But I as far as I understand it now,
          which is, I don't understand very well, but the way I understand it
          now, it is a very harsh trade-off that you make because if you enjoy
          doing technical work and then at some point become a manager you're
          probably gonna do very little to zero technical work for the rest of
          your career. So, I'm also very wary of that. I'm gonna finish my
          graduate program in one and a half years. Hopefully GN's gonna have a
          nice position for me then or someone else in Denmark because I really
          like living there and hopefully, by that point, I'll also know a bit
          better what I want to work as. That's the reason I'm in the graduate
          program because I want to figure that out a bit and right now I don't
          really know and I'm just trying to take the whole experience in and
          ideally ask a lot of stupid questions to understand how things work in
          this company that I'm in.

        <h4>
          If someone was in your shoes and they don't really know where to take
          their careers, what do you think they could do to get closer to that
          answer?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Again, I think I think the single best thing you probably can do is
          interview people, go to people who do... Oh, you got me! I think
          that's always been the best thing for me throughout the entire time
          is, get a look at and get a taste of what different jobs are like, ask
          them, why do you like doing your job? Why do you like being whatever
          engineering specialist? Why do you like being an engineering manager?
          Why do you like being a... How did you become senior product
          development engineer or whatever. I'm in the lucky position that now I
          have all of these people around me, so, I want to try to ask some of
          those people time and again. Take some time and kind of the directions
          that do interest me a little bit. Find some people who do that work
          and and have a coffee with them, have a tea with them, have a, you
          know, whatever beverage you like to consume with them.

          "The way I was looking at it is, if everything goes alright, like,
          what's the best I can ever be in this position and let's say that was
          like some really high up engineer or manager, I don't know. And then I
          would ask myself, in the best case scenario, would I be happy with
          that? In that case the answer was no, so that's one thing and another
          thing is, like, if you start hoping that the culture is gonna change
          or something big that is really out of your reach, then I also think
          it's a good sign because most likely something like that will not
          change."
